HTML: Utilized classes and id's to isolate tags and elements in the website for CSS manipulation.

CSS: Utilizing CSS through a style sheet, created fonts, background, text, and formatting elements for the website. Animations include: shaking fish, cookie rotation, hovering buttons on the aside, fade in text in the main body, and the 'heat' for "hot merch"

JS: primarily for the creation of the interactive sales table and event-form elements. Utilized DOM manipulation to achieve the functionality of the table and form. *attempted to get the table to be editable through isolating each entry and calling an event but had little success*

I wish Pat all the luck with his new business, and that this website is a small piece of his (potential) success
